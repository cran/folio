Description: Datasets for teaching quantitative approaches and
    modeling in archaeology and paleontology. This package provides
    several types of data related to broad topics (cultural evolution,
    radiocarbon dating, paleoenvironments, etc.), which can be used to
    illustrate statistical methods in the classroom (multivariate data
    analysis, compositional data analysis, diversity measurement, etc.).
